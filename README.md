# PRODIGY_DS_02
Problem Statement

Perform data cleaning and EDA on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset. Explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in data. 

**LIBRARIES**
1. Pandas:
Purpose: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like Series and DataFrame, which are designed for efficiently analyzing large datasets.

2.Matplotlib:
Purpose: Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library that produces static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It can be used for creating a wide variety of plots and charts.

3.Seaborn:
Purpose: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

4.StandardScaler:
Purpose: The StandardScaler is a preprocessing technique used to standardize the features of a dataset. Standardization is the process of rescaling the features so that they have the properties of a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

• Matplotlib.pyplot is used for bar plots and histograms
• Pandas and Matplotlib for grouped bar plots (grouped bar plots are used when there is a need to compare two attributes in the dataset)
• Seaborn and Matplotlib for violin plots and heatmaps

**DATA PREPROCESSING**
1. Handling Missing Values (Identify and fill or remove missing values in the dataset)
2. Data Transformation (Standardize or normalize numerical features)
3. Splitting the Dataset (Split the dataset into training and testing sets)
4. Data Exploration (Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization techniques)
5. Handling Duplicate Data (Identify and remove duplicate entries)
6. Data Preparation for Modeling (Ensure the data is in a format suitable for the chosen machine learning algorithm)
